Georgios Varnavides is Assistant Professor of Imaging Physics at Delft University of Technology, where he leads the Curious Beams Lab.
He is a lead developer of the widely used open-source electron microscopy analysis packages py4DSTEM and quantEM, and serves as co-editor of Elemental Microscopy, a new open-access, open-science journal dedicated to interactive and reproducible scientific communication in electron microscopy. 
Before joining TU Delft, he was a Miller Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, where he developed novel methods for low-dose computational electron microscopy. 
Georgios is best known for his work on electron diffractive imaging and on solving large-scale, nonconvex inverse scattering problems, with applications in both materials science and the life sciences. 
His current research focuses on advancing electron imaging and instrumentation—particularly at lower accelerating energies—to probe structural and functional properties of complex systems.
