Georgios is Assistant Professor of Imaging Physics at Delft University of Technology, where he leads the Curious Beams Lab.
He is a lead developer of the widely used open-source electron microscopy analysis packages [py4DSTEM](https://github.com/py4dstem/py4DSTEM) and [quantEM](https://github.com/electronmicroscopy/quantem), and serves as co-editor of [Elemental Microscopy](https://www.elementalmicroscopy.org/), a new open-access, open-science journal dedicated to interactive and reproducible scientific communication in microscopy. 
Before joining TU Delft, he was a Miller Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.

Willem began his PhD in November 2025.
Last year, he earned a Master’s in Econometrics from Tilburg University, and earlier this year, he completed a Master’s in Applied Physics at Eindhoven University of Technology.
Choosing between these fields was not easy, but during his internship at ASML’s Research Department, Willem discovered his passion for imaging techniques—a perfect intersection of his interests in mathematics and physics.
That experience also inspired his curiosity and ambition to pursue a career in research.

Mathijs completed his applied physics Bachelor End Project (BEP) in the Curious Beams Lab in December 2025, focusing on implementing higher-order corrections to the multislice formalism in the open-source simulation package [abTEM](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM).
He is currently working on applying the principle of reciprocity to simulate partially coherent electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) patterns.

:name: Jianyao Jin
:position: PhD Researcher (co-advised with [Kees Hagen](https://www.tudelft.nl/tnw/over-faculteit/afdelingen/imphys/about-the-department/hagen-kees))

Jianyao started his PhD in April 2024, focusing on improving physics models to more accurately simulate low-energy electron–matter interactions.
The interaction of sub-100 eV electrons with samples in scanning electron microscopy is not yet fully understood, as conventional SEMs typically operate at kilovolt energies.
The Nebula simulator of electron–matter interaction incorporates state-of-the-art scattering physics models at the time of its creation, but currently lacks descriptions of key low-energy processes or relies on models whose assumptions break down in this regime.
Jianyao has a background in applied physics, with a focus on computational physics and quantum information and quantum internet applications.
