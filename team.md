Georgios Varnavides is Assistant Professor of Imaging Physics at Delft University of Technology, where he leads the Curious Beams Lab.
He is a lead developer of the widely used open-source electron microscopy analysis packages py4DSTEM and quantEM, and serves as co-editor of Elemental Microscopy, a new open-access, open-science journal dedicated to interactive and reproducible scientific communication in electron microscopy. 
Before joining TU Delft, he was a Miller Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, where he developed novel methods for low-dose computational electron microscopy.
