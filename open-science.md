title: Open Science
---

We are deeply committed to open science and transparent research practices.
We believe that lowering barriers to entry and providing accessible tools accelerates scientific progress and amplifies research impact. 

All code developed in our lab is made publicly available through open-source repositories, enabling reproducibility and fostering collaboration across the microscopy and materials science communities. 
Beyond sharing code, we also provide [interactive preprints](./computational-articles.md) of our work that allow readers to explore results, test parameters, and engage directly with our research findings.
Below are the main open-source organizations and repositories we're actively involved in:
